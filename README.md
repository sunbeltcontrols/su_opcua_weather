# su_opcua_weather
 Simple weather service

## Getting Started

Mapping in your own api key via configParser would be ideal so as to avoid sharing api keys!



### Installing

You will need to install the requirements via pip.

'''
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''



### Usage
Run the service locally and test via workbench connection to localhost to verify functionality locally before attemping to
connect to a remote server.

Use the OPCUA variable "Location" to set the location to be queried (from the Niagara OPCUA Network).
